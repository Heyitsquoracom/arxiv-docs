# Frequently Asked Questions on Public Statistics

  - ### I'd like to know how many people have been downloading/reading my work. Are there any plans to add this facility?
    
    No, because we cannot guarantee the statistics we have are accurate, and we do not wish to publish potentially misleading statistics.

  - ### Why?

    arXiv has a strong philosophic reason for not publicizing these statistics.
    
  - ## Do you plan to use download statistics in any way?

    Yes, we track and report the number of [downloads from arXiv](../../help/usage-data/index.md) and for our [institutional membership](../../about/membership.md), but we do not track by individual papers.
